## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for **City Skaters**, a mobile game focused on performance, responsive controls, and scalability. It was developed with a strong emphasis on smooth gameplay, modular code architecture, and optimisation for mobile devices.

### Core Objectives:
1. **Technical Competence**: The project features various technical aspects such as a the procedurally generated map, which is being designed to be easily expanded, and produce fun gameplay for the player.
2. **Optimization**: The game should be optimized for mobile devices, to ensure the smoothest experience for the player
3. **Cohesive Gameplay**: The gameplay systems are designed and implemented in a manner which makes sense. This includes but is not limited to the Touch Control Tool, which is used throughout the game to determine what the player swipes and touches do and mean to the underlying systems.

Players control a skater via intuitive swipe controls to perform tricks and grinds across a procedurally generated city map. A global leaderboard adds competitive replayability, encouraging players to improve their combos and reach higher scores.

## Developer Notes

This project was developed using agile methodologies, with continuous playtesting and iterative improvements. A strong focus was placed on:
- Performance optimisation using object pooling and profiler tools
- Clean, scalable architecture using design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Mediator)
- Readability and maintainability of code

Collaborated with Amber Bowen. Her concepts and work on the character is invaluable, and made this game feel more complete.

Huge thanks to the playtesters for their feedback:
- Daniel Osei-Nimo
- Nikola Milosev

This repository represents not only the culmination of my degree, but a showcase of my technical, creative, collaboration and project management skills as a developer.
