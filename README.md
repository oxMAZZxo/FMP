### 🎯 Core Objectives:
1. **Technical Competence**: The project features various technical aspects such as a the procedurally generated map, which is being designed to be easily expanded, and produce fun gameplay for the player.
2. **Optimization**: The game should be optimized for mobile devices, to ensure the smoothest experience for the player
3. **Cohesive Gameplay**: The gameplay systems are designed and implemented in a manner which makes sense. This includes but is not limited to the Touch Control Tool, which is used throughout the game to determine what the player swipes and touches do and mean to the underlying systems.

Players control a skater via intuitive swipe controls to perform tricks and grinds across a procedurally generated city map. A global leaderboard adds competitive replayability, encouraging players to improve their combos and reach higher scores.
